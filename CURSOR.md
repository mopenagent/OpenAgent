# OpenAgent — Cursor Project Context

## What We're Building

**OpenAgent** is a **deterministic**, **extension-first** hybrid Python + Go agent platform. It orchestrates multi-agent pipelines using offline 14B-parameter models on low-power hardware (Raspberry Pi primary target).

The architecture has two planes:
- **Python Control Plane (Brain)** — LLM interfacing, multi-agent orchestration, platform integrations, stateless async core loop.
- **Go Services (Hands)** — Long-lived daemon processes for CPU/IO-intensive work. Python spawns, monitors, and manages them. They communicate via MCP-lite (tagged JSON over Unix sockets).

OpenAgent uses a **custom ReAct loop** and thin provider layer (no framework dependency). Session/memory uses a `SessionBackend` protocol. OpenAgent remains responsible for extension/service orchestration, MCP-lite lifecycle, and deployment constraints for low-power hardware. See `roadmap.md` for rationale.

## Design Principles

1. **Communication Protocol** — Whenever the user sends an input where their intention needs clarification or context needs expansion, do not assume the correct path. Ask clarifying questions **one by one**, provide possible options/paths, and record/apply this explicitly in every conversation.
2. **Deterministic behavior** — Explicit control flow, reproducible execution paths. Aligns with smaller local models where reliability matters more than flexibility.
3. **Two planes, clear boundary** — Python extensions handle platforms (WhatsApp, Discord) and media (TTS, STT). Go services handle compute and data-intensive work. Never mix them.
4. **Service-first for compute** — New heavy capabilities go in `services/<name>/` as Go daemons, not in Python extensions.
5. **First-class async** — Python core and all extensions are async-first. No blocking I/O in Python extension code.
6. **Tool-oriented** — Capabilities are exposed as tools the LLM can call. Python tools run in-process; Go service tools are declared in `service.json` and proxied through `ServiceManager`.
7. **Offline and low-power friendly** — Designed for a 14B local model on Raspberry Pi. Keep core lean, keep context concise, lazy-load everything heavy. Vector search (LanceDB) executes directly via Python to leverage Rust core without JSON IPC serialization tax.
8. **Workflow Orchestrator (Zero-Copy Artifacts)** — Python acts as a workflow router. Go services dump heavy binaries to `data/artifacts/` and return a file path. Python pipes that path as an argument to the next step. LLMs are treated as non-deterministic nodes in a larger deterministic workflow graph. No direct Go-to-Go (East-West) communication.

|---|---|---|---|
| Agent loop, tool registry | `openagent/agent/` | Python | Custom ReAct loop (no framework) |
| LLM provider registry | `openagent/providers/` | Python | httpx-based, Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenAI-compat |

| Session manager | `openagent/session/` | Python | SessionBackend protocol, SQLite impl |
| Message bus | `openagent/bus/` | Python | InboundMessage, OutboundMessage, SenderInfo |
| Service platform adapters (MCP-lite clients) | `openagent/platforms/` | Python | Shared `mcplite.py` + per-service adapter |

## Extension Contract

Python extensions implement `AsyncExtension` from `openagent.interfaces`:

```python
async def initialize(self) -> None: ...   # startup — no blocking
async def shutdown(self) -> None: ...     # graceful stop
def get_status(self) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
```

Extend `BaseAsyncExtension`. Register via `pyproject.toml` entry point:

```toml
[project.entry-points."openagent.extensions"]
my-ext = "plugin:MyExtension"
```

Extension source layout: flat at `extensions/<name>/src/` — no nested package folders.

## Service Contract

Go services implement the **MCP-lite** wire protocol over a Unix Domain Socket:

```
Socket:  data/sockets/<name>.sock
Frames:  newline-delimited JSON, bidirectional

Agent → Service:
  {"id":"<uuid>","type":"tools.list"}
  {"id":"<uuid>","type":"tool.call","tool":"<name>","params":{...}}
  {"id":"<uuid>","type":"ping"}

Service → Agent:
  {"id":"<uuid>","type":"tools.list.ok","tools":[...]}
  {"id":"<uuid>","type":"tool.result","result":"...","error":null}
  {"id":"<uuid>","type":"pong","status":"ready"}
  {"type":"event","event":"<name>","data":{...}}   ← unprompted push, no id
```

Service manifest (`service.json`) declares: name, binary paths per arch, socket path, health config, tool schemas, event types.

`ServiceManager` in core: reads manifests → spawns binary → connects socket → registers tools → health-checks → restarts on crash.

## Files to Change: Extensions

When editing a Python extension, change only files under `extensions/<name>/`:

- `pyproject.toml` — package metadata, dependencies, entry point
- `src/plugin.py` — extension entry point, implements `AsyncExtension`
- `src/<component>.py` — component logic (connector, bridge, schema, etc.)
- `tests/` — extension tests

Do not change `openagent/` or other extensions.

## Files to Change: Web UI

When editing the web UI, change only files under `app/`:

- `app/main.py` — FastAPI app instance, route registration, lifespan
- `app/routes/<page>.py` — Route handler for each page
- `app/templates/<page>.html` — Jinja2 template for each page
- `app/templates/base.html` — Shared layout (nav, sidebar, content slot)
- `app/static/` — CSS and vendored HTMX JS

Do not add FastAPI routes or UI logic to `openagent/`. The UI is a consumer of core, not part of it.

## Files to Change: Go Services

When editing a Go service, change only files under `services/<name>/`:

- `main.go` — UDS server, MCP-lite protocol handler
- `service.json` — service manifest (the only contract with Python core)
- `go.mod` / `go.sum` — Go module definition
- `bin/` — compiled binaries (gitignored)
- `*_test.go` — Go unit tests

Do not change `openagent/` or any extension when working on a service.

## Development Conventions

**Python:**
- Python ≥ 3.11
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` for all extensions
- Run: `python -m openagent.main` or `openagent`
- Verify extensions: `python -c "import importlib.metadata as m; print(m.entry_points(group='openagent.extensions'))"`
- `aiohttp` for HTTP — never `requests` or OpenAI SDK
- `asyncio.to_thread()` for sync libs in async context

**Go:**
- Go ≥ 1.21
- Build: `cd services/<name> && go build -o bin/<name> .`
- Cross-compile for Pi: `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o bin/<name>-linux-arm64 .`
- Run tests: `cd services/<name> && go test ./...`

**Config:** `config/openagent.yaml` — primary config. Env vars override with `OPENAGENT_` prefix.

**Web UI:**
```bash
pip install -e app/
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload
# visit http://<pi-ip>:8080
```

## When Editing This Project

- **Core** — Keep it minimal. Add orchestration and interfaces; avoid domain logic and heavy dependencies.
- **New platform/media feature** — New Python extension under `extensions/`.
- **New compute/data feature** — New Go service under `services/` with `service.json`.
- **Async only (Python)** — All extension lifecycle and handlers must be `async def`. No blocking.
- **Goroutine per request (Go)** — Never block the accept loop. Graceful SIGTERM handling.
- **Determinism** — Explicit, reproducible flows. Stable tool schemas. Clear LLM-readable descriptions.
- **14B / Pi target** — Lean context, lazy loading, no heavy deps in core.

## Observability Baseline (Agreed)

- Add shared Python observability helpers under `openagent/observability/`.
- Use structured logs with correlation ids for extension lifecycle, provider calls, and MCP-lite traffic.
- Expose Prometheus metrics at `GET /metrics` from `app/main.py`.
- Track operation latency/error for STT/TTS and MCP-lite request-response paths.
- Keep logs privacy-safe: never log full message bodies or secrets.
- Mirror structured request observability in Go services for parity.
